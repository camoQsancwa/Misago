## Features
 
Ilya Efimov Acoustic Guitar KONTAKT Complete is a collection of two acoustic guitars: a six-string steel guitar and a twelve-string guitar. Both guitars were recorded with multiple microphones and articulations, giving you a wide range of options to shape your sound. You can choose from different playing techniques, such as fingerstyle, strumming, harmonics, slides, mutes, and more. You can also adjust the tuning, tone, volume, pan, and effects of each guitar.
 
The library comes with a custom interface that allows you to control various parameters and settings. You can switch between different modes, such as solo mode, chord mode, pattern mode, and song mode. Solo mode lets you play individual notes and phrases with realistic legato and vibrato. Chord mode lets you play chords with different voicings and inversions. Pattern mode lets you play rhythmic patterns with different styles and grooves. Song mode lets you create your own songs by combining patterns and chords.
 
The library also comes with a built-in effects section that includes reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, EQ, compressor, and limiter.
